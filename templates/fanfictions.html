<p style="font-size:250%;">Fanfiction(1)</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;">In a world where magic has ceased to exist for hundreds of years, a sole male possesses an unknown power. It slumbers deep within him, churning and pleaded to come out.

But, he does not know what it is.

He's an everyday, ordinary man, with a mediocre job and tiny apartment and an obnoxious downstairs neighbor. Edward Cullen does not know what is in store for him when something inside him awakens and makes him the most powerful man in the world.

Goodbye, mediocrity ...

She is like him, ordinary, mediocre and stuck in a loveless marriage to a monster where she endures his anger and rage. But, within her soul, is another type of energy. It keeps her alive and pushes her forward, but she wishes it would just go away. Isabella Black just wants to end the nightmare of her life and start new.

Walking into a lawyer's office, she meets Edward Cullen and something between the two of them sparks. Not as a client and attorney.

Something deeper ...

Could it be the magic within?</p>

<p style="font-size:200%;">Edward Cullen is the heir-apparent to the most infamous crime families in Chicago. He was notorious for his time with his enemies, his many dates and his ruthless skill in the board room, the front for the illicit dealings of the Cullen Crime Consortium. However, to take over the family, his father reminded him about the stipulation that Edward needed to be married. Edward hated that stipulation, but he agreed to it and he had less than a year to make it a reality.

Isabella Swan is a struggling graduate student, working as a waitress in a local diner, The Swan Dive. On a chance meeting, Edward finds Bella to be enchanting and the perfect woman to marry. He makes an indecent proposal, suggesting marriage and paying for Bellaâ€™s tuition, and then some. Will Bella accept his proposal, with the possibility of having her dreams come true, but married to a sexy, enigmatic rich businessman? Or will she figure out the truth, that her future-husband is Married to the Mob?</p>
